# DSA-Music-Player

The project is a fully functional music player application developed in C++ using a linked list data structure to manage the playlist. It allows users to play, pause, skip tracks, and perform other basic playback controls. The user interface provides an intuitive way to interact with the player, allowing users to manage their music library effectively.

# Features

• Playback Controls: Play, pause, skip tracks, and other basic playback functions.

• Playlist Management: Add, remove, and reorder tracks using a linked list.

• User Interface: Intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy interaction.

# Technical Details
• Linked List Data Structure:- Understanding and implementing the linked list data structure to manage the playlist taught valuable lessons about:

• Dynamic Memory Allocation:- Allocating and deallocating memory for playlist nodes.

•Node Manipulation:- Adding, removing, and updating nodes in the linked list.

•Traversal:- Navigating through the linked list to manage and play tracks.
