# DSA-Music-Player
The project is a fully functional music player application developed in C++ using a linked list data structure to manage the playlist. It allows users to play, pause, skip tracks, and perform other basic playback controls. The user interface provides an intuitive way to interact with the player, allowing users to manage their music library effectively.Understanding and implementing the linked list data structure to manage the playlist taught valuable lessons about dynamic memory allocation, node manipulation, and traversal.Implementing error handling mechanisms and conducting thorough testing helped identify and address bugs, improve reliability, and enhance user satisfaction. Managing dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in the linked list structure required careful attention to prevent memory leaks and segmentation faults.
